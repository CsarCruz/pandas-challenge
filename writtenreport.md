## Written Report

The PyCitySchool Analysis is a very complete report that took two data base and merge in one so we can have a complete picture of School and students
behavior.

In this report, I took the whole universe of information and after organized and filter is easier to comprehend and undestand the relationship 
of some of the variables. For example we found:

*Number of students

*Total budget

  *Percentaje of students that passeed math, reading, and both.
  
  *We have the information from above but organized by school.
  
  *Highest and lowest performing schools.
  
  *Scores by grade.
  
  *Scores by school.
  
  
  ## Two conclussions
  
  1. There is no correlation between Total School Budget and overall passing because two of the schools that expend the most are in the low part
  of the table.
  
  2. Pena High School is worth a more exhaustive analysis because is one of the school with whe lowest budgest and is on the top five.
